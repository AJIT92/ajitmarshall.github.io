---

Empathetic human being who loves to code, read, and wonder about the universe.

Also a small business owner, [Skcript](https://www.skcript.com). We built a
compression server for the enterprise, [SHRINK](https://www.skcript.com/shrink)
and a work management tool, [Allt](https://allt.in).

Currently Ruby and Python are my addictions. I dabble a bit in server management,
machine learning, and anything that keeps me curious. Also love to speak about
code, tech and startups.
