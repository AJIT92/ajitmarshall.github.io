Hi! I'm Swaathi. A curious human being who loves to code, read and wonder about
the mysteries of the universe.

I'm currently living my dream at [Skcript](https://skcript.com) where we build
[SHRINK](https://skcript.com/shrink) and [Allt](https://skcript.come/Allt).

Tweet at [@imswaathik](http://twitter.com/imswaathik), read my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/swaathi), delve into my mind via
[blog.skcript.com](https://blog.skcript.com).

This theme is made by [Mu-An](http://muan.co). You have a nice day. â™¥
