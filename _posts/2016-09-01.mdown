Every man's dream is to build their own empire and it is becoming a trend today,and even the society has taken a new formation of achieving those goals,the startup revolution made me think a lot which led me to exploring the deep dark secrets,and i was curious about how to expand my contacts with the people who were called as CEO's.Finally the day arrived which i dreamed off,but i felt i was nothing compared to those(CEO's) whom u would never have a chance to met often,because they are busy in fundraising,abroad trips,client meeting and have less quality time to spend with their family.

 As its mentioned i was to aspiring to do something about it and did some homework to build up my skill for the event,i had some dream startup companies which i liked to visit such as MAD(Mad street den), ORANGESCAPE,PAYPAL INCUBATOR,UNMETRIC,CHARGEBEE,ENTRYN and etc,but i couldn't add MAD on my list,it's a startup which deals with Augmented Reality and i was so inspired after reading an article of  Ashwini Ashokan(CEO) in Your story website.I didn't realize that i would be the only person who is still studying, while people who participated in this event were Senior Managers,Chartered Accountant,Angel Investors and other Startup CEO'S this environment was so new to me i taught of going back home but my intuitions made to stay cause it realized it was important to me to satisfy my startup hunger.

The day started my visiting all the startup companies which were located in IT Parks, Underground building and some even were using an Apartment as their office space which seemed to cool for me.Finally the day ended which dinner were we had chances of networking with all the CEO's of the companies i had mentioned earlier and that was the point of time i realized how networking with people would be so effective,i went and sat near a group of people who were from the same office space and started to listen to their conversation and everyone who spoke were keen in expressing  their ideas of the event.

With lot of confidence and ideas in mind and a goal to achieve something huge that would be difficult for

 others to fulfill in their later years, made me realize how important for someone who is starving with hunger must work hard to earn their bread.
