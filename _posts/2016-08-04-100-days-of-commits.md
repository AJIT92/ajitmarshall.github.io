Of all the innovative ideas to bring more people into open source, this has got to take the prize. [#100DaysOfCommits](https://100daysofcommits.github.io/) is a social movement to promote open source development. All you need to do is commit on [Github](https://github.com), to an open source project of your choice for the next 100 days! 1 commit (or more, common challenge yourself!) per day.

<!--break-->

Once you've done that take a picture or screenshot the commit along with the link to the repo, and post it to Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag, #100DaysOfCommits. There's even a raffle involved!

> #100DaysOfCommits is a community project that's partnering with local coding meetups. We want to encourage people to get involved in Open Source and to start their own side projects. There's a raffle involved!

We are super excited at Skcript to join this movement. Almost everyone here has contributed to at least one open source project during their time here. We love [giving back](http://skcript.github.io/) to, and there's so much of our production code we've open sourced.

> #100DaysOfCommits starts on August 1st, 2016 and ends November 9th, 2016.

For today here are the repos our engineers are contributing to,

- [rails/rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
- [skcript/GDGChennai](https://github.com/skcript/GDGChennai)
- [varun-raj/medium-editor-autolist](https://github.com/varun-raj/medium-editor-autolist)

Stay tuned! We'll be posting images of the craziness that comes with code here soon!
