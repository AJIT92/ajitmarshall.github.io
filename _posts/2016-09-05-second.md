Being a developer is so easy,but becoming one is too hard as we try to create a magic which is never had beeen performed by other,these skills can never be gained by learning books or so, we should have the passion in building such skills.

The Real Deal!!

I am a person who does not like to curdle with books all the time,I would love to learn from others experiences and mistakes,I really dreamt of codes all the time which i didnt knew and months passed by trying to find my space ,where atlast I landed in Vajro.I am currently working as a Android Developer Intern.

It all started by exploring the search engine(Google),trying to find out events for developers like crazy,and landed up in so called event GDG Devfest Chennai-2016,I wondered is this happening in my own city In most cases technology events are  conducted in banglore rather than chennai and I was glad about it,but to my anxiety the event registration was about to close in a day,so i rushed up in registering the event as soon as possible expecting for the invite to landup in my gmail account.To my disappointment I didn't really get the invite coz the invitations were limited.However I managed to send emails to the organizing team to send me ticket,and they finally did without
