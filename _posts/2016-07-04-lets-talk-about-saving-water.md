I've always been ridiculously OCD about saving water. I hate the drip-drip sound
of leaky taps, unnecessary usage of sprinklers in the summer, and on and on. So,
there's a little thing we do at [Skcript](https://www.skcript.com) on this cause.

We have a lot(!) of plants at office. From small bamboo plants on everyone's desk,
to large Araceae palms. I absolutely love the smell of petrichor, and I treat myself
to it almost everyday watering these plants.

So here's how we save water at Skcript. Every evening once we're ready to go back
home, all of us pour the remaining water in our bottles into a large pot. The next
day we simply use this reserve water for the plants! So simple, but you won't believe
the amount of water we save.

This overly cautious mindset got me piqued the interest of [Chaaipani](http://chaaipani.com/), a wonderful blog by the wonderful [Shruti Chaturvedi](https://twitter.com/adhicutting).
